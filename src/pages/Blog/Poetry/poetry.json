//     "body":"We chase logic. And we seek reason.\nTry to control, both the ship and its captain.\nNightmares turned to dreams, dreams into reality.\nHow long until another impossible's made to happen?\n\nBut a little too often, these dreams turn ridiculous.\nLike a longing to be dragged, into a parallel universe.\nWhere gravity pulls us up, everything else, nebulous.\nWhere things'd be different, for better or for worse.\n\nFor when space and time, neither stretch nor bend,\nTrees grow into seeds, and thunder sounds first,\nThere will be no end to life, and yet, no life to end.\nAs the law of reverse effect, itself would be reversed.\n\nWhere it's tropical at the poles, freezing at sea level.\nHomes built from lego, clouds our riding vessel.\nWhere the sea leaves burns and fire cools its flame.\nPeople see your passion, nobody asks your name.\n\nAnd if stars could talk, they'd let you in on this secret.\nThat nothing is a mystery and nothing is amiss.\nAnd yet, trying to make sense of it, do try & tell me,\nHow could a world, get any topsy-turvier than this?"
