      I'm a person with multiple, ordinary interests and very little patience, not much unlike every other 
      GenZ kid out there. I like spending time stalking art and music pages and not once have I stopped wishing for 
      a rather peaceful life of a Pokemon trainer. I try to learn new things every once in a while when the realization, 
      that having deep and wise thoughts all the time isn't gonna get me anywhere, dawns on me.

      <h2 className="home_text_big2">
      I'm a CS undergrad student, currently studying in MEC, Kochi. For the longest time I wanted to 
      be an astrophysicist cuz duh, it's cool. But well, does anything ever go according to plan? Sigh.
      At the moment, I'm quite interested in technology as well. 
      <br/>
      Still a Rookie though.
      <p>¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p>

      I like playing the keyboard, and sometimes succeed in hiding the impatience that resonates through it. 
      Sketching is also a stress-buster for me from time to time. On that note, here's a list of things I enjoy...
