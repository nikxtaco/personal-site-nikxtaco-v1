      <h2 className="about_text">
      I'm a person with multiple, ordinary interests and very little patience, not much unlike every other 
      GenZ kid out there. I like spending time stalking art and music pages and not once have I stopped wishing for 
      a rather peaceful life of a Pokemon trainer. I try to learn new things every once in a while when the realization, 
      that having deep and wise thoughts all the time isn't gonna get me anywhere, dawns on me.

      <h2 className="about_text">
      I'm a CS undergrad student, currently studying in MEC, Kochi. For the longest time I wanted to 
      be an astrophysicist cuz duh, it's cool. But well, does anything ever go according to plan? Sigh.
      At the moment, I'm quite interested in technology as well. 
      <br/>
      Still a Rookie though.
